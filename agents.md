THEY MAY ONLY DO THIS WITH ONE HOOP AT A TIME, WITH ANY SUCCESSFUL SHOT ON ANOTHER HOOP REPLACING THE PREVIOUS THEFT. THIS AGENT ALSO MAY NOT LEAVE THE SLICE THEY HAVE CLAIMED, ELSE FORFEIT THE THEFT AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL OWNER. 

*DRIVEN BY THE WARMTH AND FORCE OF THE IMAGINATION*
- FOR EACH TWO TURNS THIS AGENT STAYS ON THE SAME SLICE, ADD +1 TO ANY SCORING THEY MAKE. THERE IS NO LIMIT TO HOW MANY EXTRA +1'S CAN BE ADDED TO THE SCORING MODIFIER. IF THE AGENT LEAVES A SLICE, THEIR MODIFIER IS RESET TO ZERO.

IF YOU ARE HOLDING A BALL, YOU CAN MAKE ANOTHER BLESSED SHOT FOR NO EXTRA COST. YOU DO NOT LOSE THE BALL.

*ELEMENTARY MACHINE LIFE*
- WHENEVER THIS AGENT USES THE "PASS" ACTION SUCCESSFULLY, IT COUNTS AS A SCORE. THE TYPE OF SCORE DEPENDS ON HOW FAR AWAY THIS AGENT IS FROM THEIR OWN PLAYERS HOOP. USUALLY IT COUNTS AS A SINGLE, BUT IF THEY ARE OVER 30cm AWAY IT COUNTS AS A TWO AND OVER 50cm AWAY COUNTS AS A THREE.

*UPON ONE PAIR OF ENGLISH LEGS*
- AT THE END OF THEIR PLAYERS TURN, THIS AGENT TAKES 5 DAMAGE. THEY TAKE 1 LESS DAMAGE FOR EACH 4cm THEY MOVE, WITH 16cm WORTH OF MOVEMENT MEANING THEY TAKE ZERO DAMAGE. IF THEY MOVE OVER ANOTHER AGENT, THAT AGENT TAKES 1 DAMAGE FOR EACH 6cm OF MOVEMENT IT TOOK TO REACH THEM. 

*AN INCESTUOUS ACT THAT GOD COMMITTED UPON REALITY*

*THREE HUNDRED WINTERS*
- THIS AGENT CAN PLACE A "FREEZE ZONE", ANY AGENT WHO ENTERS THIS ZONE TAKES 3 DAMAGE. REPEATED ENTRIES WILL APPLY THE SAME EFFECT, EXITING WILL DO NO HARM. "ENTERING" ALSO APPLIES TO ANYONE WITHIN THE ZONE AS IT IS PLACED. THE FREEZE ZONE CAN ONLY BE PLACED ONCE AND REMAINS UNTIL THE AGENT WHO PLACED IT DIES.

*COME FORTH, O CHILDREN, UNDER THE STARS*
- EVERY TIME THIS AGENT MAKES A FULL REVOLUTION AROUND THE FIELD, STARTING FROM WHEREVER THEY WERE ORIGINALLY PLACED (WHICH YOU SHOULD MARK WITH A "PEDESTRIAN PIECE"), THEY SCORE THE EQUIVALENT TO A TWO IN THEIR HOOP.

*CREATION OF STRANGE MATTER*
- ANY BALL THIS AGENT PICKS UP GETS REPLACED WITH A "STRANGE BALL", FOR ANY SCORING EVENT INVOLVING A STRANGE BALL (E.G, A SHOT TAKEN USING ONE), THE SHOOTER WILL BE DEALT AS MUCH DAMAGE AS WAS SCORED (I.E, IF A TOTAL OF 3 POINTS WERE ADDED THANKS TO AN AGENTS SHOT, THAT AGENT TAKES 3 DAMAGE). THE SAME APPLIES TO THE AGENT WITH THIS TRAIT, EXCEPT THEY GET HEALED HOWEVER MUCH SCORE THEY SCORE. THERE MAY ONLY BE ONE STRANGE BALL IN PLAY AT A TIME, WITH ANY PREVIOUS STRANGE BALL BEING REPLACED WITH A REGULAR BALL IF THIS AGENT PICKS UP ANOTHER NON STRANGE BALL. IF THIS AGENT DIES, THE STRANGE BALL STAYS AND IS NOT REMOVED OR REPLACED. 

*LOADED WITH BUCKSHOT*
- WHENEVER THIS AGENT USES THE "SPIKE" ACTION, MAKE A 45 DEGREE ANGLE CENTERED ON THIS AGENT WITH A RANGE EXTENDING TO THE TARGET. IF THE SPIKE ROLL IS SUCCESSFUL, ANY AGENT WITHIN THAT SPACE WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE RESULTING SPIKE AND TAKE THE RESULTING DAMAGE.

*AND WE SHALL DRAW FROM THE HEART OF SUFFERING*
- WHEN THIS AGENT USES THE "PASS" ACTION SUCCESSFULLY, THE AGENT THEY PASS TO IS ALLOWED TO TAKE A FREE ACTION USING THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED BALL.

*SELF-TRAITOR, I DO BRING THE SPIDER LOVE*
- THIS AGENT HAS THE "CHARGE 'N SLAM" ACTION. "CHARGE 'N SLAM" ALLOWS THIS AGENT TO MOVE TWICE THEIR NORMAL SPEED (NO SPRINT SPEED!!), IF ANY OTHER AGENTS ARE IN THEIR PATH, THEY GET PICKED UP AND MOVE ALONG WITH THIS AGENT. IF THE FINAL LOCATION OF THIS CHARGE ENDS UP BEING A HOOP. THIS AGENT THEN DUNKS EVERY AGENT THAT IT BROUGHT ALONG, EACH SCORING A SINGLE ALONG WITH DEALING 6 DAMAGE TO EACH DUNKEE. IF AN AGENT IN THE PATH OF A CHARGER IS DEFENDING, FLIP A COIN. IF HEADS, THE CHARGER SLAMS INTO THE IMMOVABLE AGENT AND TAKES 6 DAMAGE. IF IT'S TAILS, THE CHARGER BRINGS THEM ALONG AS NORMAL. 

*THE MOST MERCIFUL THING THAT A FAMILY DOES*
- THIS AGENT MAY KILL ANY TWO AGENTS INSTANTLY WITHIN 15cm OF IT. THIS TAKES AN ACTION. THOSE TWO AGENTS WILL BE REPLACED BY TWO SEPARATE "WICKED BEASTS" CARDS ON THE PLACE OF DEATH. THIS AGENT WILL THEN TURN INTO A "KIND CRITTER" CARD, LOYAL TO THE PLAYER WHOSE AGENTS WERE KILLED PREVIOUSLY. (IF TWO SEPARATE PLAYERS, FLIP A COIN).

*I WATCHED YOU ENTER YOUR HOME FROM INSIDE A DUMPSTER*
- WHEN THIS AGENT ENTERS PLAY, PLACE A DUMPSTER TOKEN WHERE THEY ARE PLACED. THEY ARE NOW IN THE DUMPSTER. AN AGENT IN THE DUMPSTER MAY NOT BE TARGETED OR OTHERWISE AFFECTED BY NORMAL ACTIONS. THE ONLY ACTIONS THEY MAY TAKE ARE BALL ACTIONS (SHOOT, SPIKE). THE ONLY MEANS FOR THEM TO ACQUIRE A BALL IS EITHER, ENTER THE DUMPSTER WITH ONE, OR GET PASSED ONE WHILE IN THE DUMPSTER. THE AGENT IN THE DUMPSTER MAY LEAVE AT ANY TIME FOR FREE, BUT YOU MAY ONLY LEAVE OR ENTER THE DUMPSTER ONCE PER TURN (IF YOU LEAVE, YOU CAN'T GO BACK IN THAT TURN, IF YOU ENTER, YOU CAN'T GO BACK OUT THAT TURN). ANY AGENT MAY ENTER THE DUMPSTER IF THEY ARE WITHIN 5cm AND IT IS EMPTY. THERE IS NO ACTION COST TO LEAVING OR ENTERING. THE DUMPSTER STAYS ON THE FIELD PERMENANTLY, EVEN IF THIS AGENT DIES.

*SCOUNDREL, ROGUE, MONSTER*
- WHEN THIS AGENT IS PLACED ON THE FIELD, PLACE A "KIND CRITTER" CARD ALONGSIDE THEM (5cm ANY DIRECTION). THIS KIND CRITTER IS LOYAL TO THIS AGENT'S PLAYER WHILE THIS AGENT IS ALIVE, WHEN THEY DIE, THE CRITTER BEGINS REVOLTING AND MUST BE REPLACED BY A "WICKED BEAST" CARD (ANY DAMAGE CARRIES OVER).

*YOU TOOK DEAD BONES AND COVERED THEM WITH BODIES*
- WHEN THIS AGENT IS ON THE FIELD, WHENEVER AN AGENT DIES, PLACE A *BONES* MARKER ON THEIR PLACE OF DEATH. IF WITHIN 5cm OF A *BONES* PIECE, THIS AGENT CAN PICK UP THIS PIECE AT NO ACTION COST AND MAY CARRY AS MANY AS THEY PLEASE. THIS AGENT MAY USE A "BONES" PIECE AS A BALL, AND MAY USE AN ACTION TO TRANSFORM THREE BONES INTO A "KIND CRITTER" CARD THAT IS LOYAL TO THEM.

*THE HOLLOWING BOOMING OF PIECES OF ORDNANCE*
- WHEN THIS AGENT USES THE "SPIKE" ACTION, AN ADDITIONAL EXPLOSION WILL OCCUR. ON A SUCCESSFUL SPIKE, THE EXPLOSION WILL OCCUR AT THE TARGET, AN UNSUCCESSFUL SPIKE WILL EXPLODE ON THIS AGENT. THIS EXPLOSION HAS A 12cm RADIUS AND DEALS 1d6+3 DAMAGE TO EACH THING WITHIN. IF THIS BALL IS CAUGHT BY A DEFENDING AGENT, THEY MAY IMMEDIATELY USE A "SPIKE" ACTION IF THEY SO WISH, WHICH WILL KEEP THE SAME EXPLOSIVE PROPERTY.

*MAY GOD DEAL WITH ME, BE IT EVER SO SEVERELY*
- IF THIS AGENT SCORES A SHOT IN A HOOP THAT IS NOT THEIR PLAYER'S, AN ADDITIONAL HALF POINTS IS SCORED TO THEIR OWN HOOP (ROUNDED UP), ASWELL AS GETTING TO TAKE A CARD FROM THE HOOPOWNER'S HAND OF THEIR CHOOSING (THEY MAY NOT SEE WHAT CARD THEY CHOOSE). IF THIS IS A DRAFT CARD, THE HOOPOWNER MUST REDRAW A DRAFT CARD.

*OUR LIGHT IS A VOICE*
- THIS AGENT ESSENTIALLY FUNCTIONS AS TWO AGENTS, ONE ACTION GIVEN TO THIS AGENT WILL ALLOW IT TO TAKE TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS. THIS AGENT MAY ALSO MOVE TWICE IN A TURN. HOWEVER, ANY OF THESE ACTIONS OR MOVEMENT MUST BE SPLIT TO ONE SIDE OF THE CARD OR ANOTHER. (IF YOU MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LEFTSIDE OF THE CARD, YOUR NEXT MOVEMENT HAS TO BE FROM THE RIGHTSIDE, SAME LOGIC FOR ANY ACTIONS, IF YOU BEAT ON ONE SIDE, YOU MUST SHOOT FROM THE OTHER)

*GIVE UP YOUR SON SO WE MAY EAT HIM*
- ALL DAMAGE THIS AGENT DEALS IS HEALED BACK TO THEM. THEIR HEALTH HAS NO MAXIMUM.

*AND NEVER WILL*
- ANY AGENTS WITHIN 15cm OF THIS AGENT HAS 2 ACCURACY AND MAY ONLY TAKE ONE ACTION PER TURN. THIS APPLIES AT THE START OF AN AGENTS TURN. (SO YOU CAN'T USE AN ACTION, MOVE OUT OF THE RADIUS, AND GET A SECOND ACTION WITH THAT AGENT)

*BETWEEN THEM AND US STANDS OUR FEAR*
- IF THIS AGENT IS HOLDING A BALL, AND IS 5cm AWAY FROM ANOTHER AGENT, AND BOTH HAVE ADEQUATE POWER TO ATTEMPT A SHOT, THEY MAY SPLIT THE BALL IN HALF AND BOTH ATTEMPT A SHOOT ACTION AT THE SAME TIME. THE PLAYER WHO HAS THIS AGENT (BETWEEN THEM AND US...) MAY DECIDE WHAT HOOP THE SECOND AGENT AIMS FOR, EVEN IF IT IS NOT THEIR AGENT. THE BALL COMBINES BACK TOGETHER AT THE END OF BOTH ACTIONS.

*REDUCTION TO ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND RADIATION*
- WHENEVER THIS AGENT IS WITHIN 15cm OF AN AGENT THAT DIES, PLACE A *FLOWER* PIECE WHERE IT DIED. FLOWER PIECES HAVE 2HP AND CAN BE TARGETED. THIS AGENT MAY USE A NEW ACTION "GROW', WHICH WILL REPLACE A FLOWER PIECE OF THEIR CHOICE WITHIN 7cm WITH A "KIND CRITTER" CARD THAT IS LOYAL TO THEM.

*STILL IN MY THOUGHT THAT LOVELY IMAGE BREATHES*
- IN EVERY ROLL INVOLVED WITH THIS AGENT (WHETHER IT IS FROM THEIR ACTION OR NOT), THEY ARE ALLOWED TO REROLL THE DICE ONE OR TWO TIMES IF THEY WISH AND MUST STICK WITH EACH NEW RESULT.

*AT ONE WITH THEIR ANTAGONISTS*
- THIS AGENT HAS EXQUISITE CONTROL AND CURVE POWER OVER THE BALL. WHEN THIS AGENT USES THE "SPIKE" ACTION AND HITS ANOTHER AGENT, THEY MAY USE THE SPIKE ACTION AGAIN FROM THE POSITION OF THEIR TARGET, WITH HALF OF THEIR (AT ONE WITH...) POWER DISTANCE. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS EFFECT MAY REAPPLY, WITH ANOTHER HALVED POWER DISTANCE.

*AS YOU ETCH ON THE INNER WINDOW OF YOUR EYE*
- EVERY ACTION THIS AGENT TAKES, ROLL A d20. IF ABOVE 14, THE ACTION HAS NO ACTION COST AND DOES NOT PREVENT THAT SPECIFIC ACTION FROM BEING USED AGAIN THIS TURN.

*CHANGE NOT AS MUCH AS THE STYLE OF A LETTER*
- SO LONG AS THIS AGENT IS ON THE FIELD, YOU (PLAYER) GET AN EXTRA ACTION TO SPEND ON ANY AGENT. WHENEVER THIS AGENT TAKES AN ACTION, FLIP A COIN. IF HEADS, THEY STUMBLE, TAKE 1 DAMAGE AND DROP THEIR BALL (IF THEY HAVE ONE) AND DO NOTHING. IF TAILS, THE ACTION GOES AHEAD AS USUAL.

*MYSTERIOUS SIGNALS FROM GLOWING ORBS*
- WHENEVER YOU PICK UP A BALL, YOU HEAR IT SPEAK TO YOU. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, YOU MUST DRAW A *BALL TRUTH* CARD AND IMMEDIATELY ACTIVATE ITS EFFECT.

*THE LONG COUNT*

*A KILLER'S APOLOGY REBUFFED*
- THIS AGENT HAS THE "MANHANDLE" ACTION. USING THIS ACTION, THIS AGENT MAY TAKE HOLD OF EVERYTHING (AGENT, SUMMON, BALL) WITHIN 9cm AND DRAG THEM ALONG WITH HALF OF THEIR BASE MOVEMENT (NO SPRINT SPEED, ONLY BASE SPEED!!). YOU CAN GRAB AS MANY THINGS AT ONCE AS YOU WANT.

*AXIOM OF CHOICE*
- THIS AGENT CAN USE THE SAME ACTION AS MANY TIMES AS THEY LIKE DURING A TURN.

*NOTE NOTES, FORSOOTH, AND NOTHING!*
- IF WITHIN 10cm OF ANOTHER AGENT, YOU MAY USE THE "COMPOSE" ACTION ON THEM. ROLL A d6. IF IT IS A 1,2,3,4, YOU MAY MOVE THEM BY THE DICE AMOUNT TIMES 3cm IMMEDIATELY. IF IT IS A 5, YOU CAN LIST AN ACTION WHICH THAT AGENT MUST TAKE ON THEIR TURN, AND A 6 AN ACTION THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE NEXT TURN. (SO IF YOU SAY THEY MUST TAKE A "BEAT" ACTION, THEY MUST TRY TO BEAT SOMETHING ON THE NEXT TURN THEIR PLAYER GETS.) IN THE RESULT OF A 5 OR 6, THE COMPOSEE MAY DISOBEY, BY EITHER NOT TAKING THE COMPOSED ACTION OR TAKING A DISALLOWED ACTION, AT THE COST OF REDUCING THEIR HEALTH TO 1HP.

*EIGHTY THOUSAND SPECIES OF MISCHEVIOUS SPIRITS*
- THIS AGENT MAY USE THE "SPEAK" ACTION TO COMMUNICATE WITH A BEAST OR CRITTER WITHIN 12cm OF YOU. ROLL A d6 AND REFER TO THE "SPEAK TABLE".
			1. THE CREATURE THINKS YOU ARE LAME. UNWORTHY. POINTLESS. IT MOVES 10cm IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF YOU.
			2. THE CREATURE GIVES YOU A BIG HUG. IT MOVES RIGHT NEXT TO YOU AND YOU TAKE 1 DAMAGE.
			3. THE CREATURE IS PLEASED WITH WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD IT, ITS SMILE HEALS YOU 6 HP.
			4. YOU'VE HURT ITS FEELINGS. THE CREATURE TAKES 5 DAMAGE.
			5. THE CREATURE IS ANGERED, IT ACTS. 
			6. THE CREATURE IS CONFUSED AND TRIES TO SPEAK BACK. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD. NOTHING HAPPENS. YOU FEEL STUPID SOMEHOW.

*SUN RITUAL*
- FOR EVERY SHOT MADE WITHIN 25cm OF THIS AGENT (PROXIMITY TO THE SHOOTER), OR MADE BY THIS AGENT, YOU GET A SUNSHINE POINT ACCORDING TO THE SCORE MADE (ONE, TWO OR THREE).

*LIKE A WALL IN WHICH AN INSECT LIVES AND GNAWS*
- THIS AGENT GETS 5 ACTIONS, THIS AGENT CAN USE A SPECIFIC ACTION TWICE. ONCE YOU FINISH YOUR TURN, IF YOU USED MORE THAN 2 ACTIONS, ASSIGN EACH OTHER CORNER PLAYER A NUMBER FROM 1-4, CENTER PLAYER IS 5-6, THEN ROLL A d6. WHOEVER IT LANDS ON GETS TO CONTROL THIS AGENT, THEY GET TO MOVE AND USE AS MANY ACTIONS YOU USED MINUS TWO. (SO IF YOU USED FOUR ACTIONS, THEY GET TWO.)

*WEREWOLVES ARE CHASING ME*
